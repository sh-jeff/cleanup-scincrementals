## Purpose
This script is designed to be run as a scheduled task. When called from the
command line, it defaults to listing all files older than 60 days.  
## Usage
To specify a different path (required for a scheduled task) use the -BackupPath
flag. -BackupPath should point to the root of the backup folder (where the 
.SPF files reside). The script expects to find .\Incrementals.  
The -RetentionDays flag specifies the number of days to *keep* from the 
newest .SPI in the folder. It does not currently do anything with the
ancillary files generated by Imagemanager.  
The -DryRun $false switch must be passed in order to actually delete files.  
-Silent is recommended for scheduled task usage.
### Examples
.\Cleanup-SCIncrementals -BackupPath "D:\Shared\Storagecraft\SERVER1"
-RetentionDays "90" -DryRun $false -Silent  
This will delete any SPI files more than 90 days old.
